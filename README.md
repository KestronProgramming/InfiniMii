The email instructions and code are designed for use with Zoho Mail, and mileage may vary for other email providers.


## Setup Storage
You will need ot setup a MongoDB server on localhost on the default port (later we will support any URL). 

A default Mii ID and such will need to be set. You can use MiiJS to get the necessary JSON if the site won't initialize without one. Paste the JSON into the miis array, and add the following fields to it.
```json
{
    "id":"default",
    "uploader":"USERNAME",
    "desc":"DESCRIPTION",
    "votes":1,
    "official":false,
    "uploadedOn":"148148148148",
    "console":"3DS"
}
```

Once you sign up for the website, find yourself in the `users` model storage, and add the 'administrator' role to your roles array.

## Running
```bash
node index.js
```
